<p>I've recently given DaemonMode a second look, and realised it's almost what I'd need it to be for use in my own workflows.</p>
<p>One major stumbling block for me, is that it does not support running code in different projects/environments. I'd think this would be akin to how when you do <code>using &lt;module&gt;</code> the module itself is loaded using its own environment. What I'm hoping, is that there's a way I could instantiate different environments and then run the (DaemonMode-constructed) anonymous modules in their appropriate environment.</p>
<p>E.g. something like this (in effect)</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Julia"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">env</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">constructenvfromprojectpath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"/path/to/project/folder"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">m</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">anon_module_within</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">Core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">:stuff</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c"># executed within the project ^</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is this possible? The docs don't seem to be particularly informative when it comes to this sort of usage.</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd also like to be able to load different versions of the same package within different project environments.</p>

<p>The answer I seem to be arriving at is "you can't"</p>

<p>Yes, you can't.  In fact, there's basically no way to do this at all within a given julia process (DaemonMode or not): once you've loaded a library once, you can't load a different version of it.  Because the package is identified by its UUID internally when it's loaded, and that UUID is fixed across versions.</p>
<p>(In principle, you could maybe subvert this mechanism in a very dirty way by fooling the system with a new set of UUIDs for each new environment.  Which would mean writing a pile of environment management code yourself.)</p>

<p>Mmm, since Saturday I've started up a new project that could end up being what I hoped DaemonMode was, with workers started up per environment. I'm currently got a few pieces of it working.</p>
