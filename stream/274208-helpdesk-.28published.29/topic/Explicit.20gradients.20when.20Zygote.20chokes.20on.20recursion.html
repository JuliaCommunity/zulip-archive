<p>I have a deeply recursive structure for which I want to be able to compute gradients with Zygote. The structure is a computation graph where each vertex has references to its inputs.</p>
<p>Problem is that Zygote randomly stalls indefinitely when compiling the backwards pass. I have up until now worked around this by first flattening the graph to a topologically sorted vector inside a <code>@nograd</code> and then doing the evaluation in a loop. However, I just realized that this approach doesn't work at all for explicit gradients which as far as I understand will soon be the mainstream (only?) way to update parameters.</p>
<p>Old discourse thread with some example code in case it is unclear what I'm talking about: <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/improve-performance-of-computation-graph-evaluation/32873">https://discourse.julialang.org/t/improve-performance-of-computation-graph-evaluation/32873</a></p>
<p>Question 1: Does anyone have an intuition about why Zygote would stall on a recursive structure? I suppose I should open an issue, but I have a hard time coming up with an MWE. The structure purposely uses some abstract and/or untypes fields to allow for mutation. Could that be the problem? Or could it be the opposite, e.g. too much specialization (which afaik also can have a negative impact on compile times) as many fields are typed and the compositional hiearachy is quite deep?</p>
<p>Question 2: Is it madness to try to stich together gradients in the pullback function of an <code>rrule</code> so that I get a Tangent vector for the flattened graph and then recurse through the graph to create a  Tangent structure which matches the graph. This is basically moving all recursion to a pre-step in the primal (flatten the graph) and a post step in the pullback (turn the flat Tangent array to a recursive Tangent structure which matches the structure of the graph) so that AD never sees any recursion. I have a (seemingly) working version of this which didn't turn out too horrible, but maybe it will be a nightmare to maintain.</p>
<p>I guess a third option is to do some <code>getproperty</code> hacking so that the flat tangent vector is backed by the graph (e.g <code>getproperty(graph, :vertices)</code> returns the flattened graph), but I don't know how to get <code>ChainRulesCore</code> to accept this.</p>

<p>It seems like recursion vs looping might be a red herring. I managed to get a model which reproduced the issue 100% for both looping and recursion and for that case the culprit seems to be related to <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/issues/1111">https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/issues/1111</a>. </p>
<p>When either stripping the graph of any mutable wrappers or defining <code>rrule</code>s for them manually I get both implicit and explicit gradients for both the looping+stiching variant and the recursive variant. Lets see if it holds up when running  more models...</p>

<p>I think both of these have come up before. Have you tried tossing the gradient call through PProf/StatProfilerHTML/etc to see where most of the time is spent? If LLVM is showing up a lot, then <a href="https://timholy.github.io/SnoopCompile.jl/stable/reference/#SnoopCompileCore.@snoopl">https://timholy.github.io/SnoopCompile.jl/stable/reference/#SnoopCompileCore.@snoopl</a> may be helpful too.</p>

<p>Mutable structs in Zygote are a massive headache :(. If I had a choice I would remove <code>setfield!</code> support entirely and wipe out a whole class of bugs + a good amount of internal complexity</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278065">@Brian Chen</span> : SnoopCompile works with gradients!? I had no idea!</p>
<p>I'll definitely try it if I run into more issues. Is there a way to make it produce output in the complete stalling case or does it need to complete before any output is generated? When it stalls, not even ctrl+C works. I need to kill the whole process.</p>

<p>SnoopCompile works with pretty much anything! Though note here I've not linked the type inference part of that library.</p>

<p>One thing I've been trying recently is:</p>
<ol>
<li>get e2e + time inference types with <code>@snoopi_deep</code></li>
<li>get LLVM time with <code>@snoopl</code></li>
<li>If inference time is high, that's a type stability issue. If LLVM times are high, that's a codegen + possible overspecialization issue. If neither is high, wow we solved TTFG</li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah, I understand the issues with mutability and Zygote. In my case the mutable structs are only mutated when doing changes to the graph (i.e changing sizes of parameter arrays or adding/removing vertices or edges), and thankfully I don't need to compute gradients for that. I think I can work around all the cases now that I know this was the culprit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Zygote will destroy type stability the moment it sees a getfield on a mutable type. Likewise if it sees control flow. I've been thinking about ways to mitigate the damage, but working in the internals is slow going and  there are a lot of edge cases to cover (e.g. nested differentiation)</p>

<p>Thats good info. I don't think I'm hurt alot by the type instability, but I guess it doesn't hurt to get rid of it. In many cases I can probably rewrite to a normal struct with some fields being <code>RefValues</code> (which are also fields which are not touched in the forward pass). Would that be an improvement?</p>
