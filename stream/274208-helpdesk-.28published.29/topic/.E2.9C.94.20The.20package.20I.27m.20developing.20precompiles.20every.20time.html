<p>Yay! After some more fiddling and relaunching it now seems to work as intended! (I got some warnings about removing stale pidfiles etc.)  Also, it seems that the package ExcelFiles (which I needed to read old .xls files that a collaborator sent me) was causing some issues, so I removed it for now.<br>
I'm not marking it as resolved yet, because I still don't understand what triggers precompilation. After another restart it's started precompiling again even though I didn't change any code...<br>
EDIT: after some more cleaning up, removing unneeded dependencies and several restarts it now finally restarts almost instantly, and the TTFP is very low :)</p>
