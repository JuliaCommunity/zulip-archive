<p>I am trying to use Julia for some low-level real time audio processing, for the moment only sound synthesis, but hopefully some analysis too later. I struggle to find good ressources and examples. Generating a sound is pretty easy with the <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/WAV">WAV.jl</a> package. The package <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/Sound">Sound.jl</a> also works, although I have troubles to select the correct sound card. </p>
<p>However, I would eventually like to synthesize new sounds while the previously computed ones are being played (without interruption). How should I approach this?</p>
<p>I also see that some people have used Julia as a controller for Pure Data. This looks like a very powerful solution, but again, the information invailable to bridge Julia and Pd is too scrace to get me started.</p>
<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated!</p>
