If you are using Jekyll, you may want to take advantage
of its [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/)
feature.

We provide a file in this directory called archive.html
that you can copy into your `_layouts` directory.  You can
modify it as needed to add more branding/information to
your archive.
