<p>I swear I had this working at some point but now autocomplete (Ctrl+Space) seems to only show perfectly matching completions, and only the first of these to boot. Tab completion does seem to do fuzzy matches but I need to hit Tab repeatedly to see the matches. Anyone know what setting(s) I may have wrong? I looked for things with names like "autocomplete", "suggest", "intellisense" but if it was in there I didn't see it.</p>
