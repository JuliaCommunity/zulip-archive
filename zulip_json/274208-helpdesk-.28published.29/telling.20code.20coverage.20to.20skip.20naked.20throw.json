For example, you can change the above to one line <code>condition &amp;&amp; error(\"I should never get here\")</code> and most code coverage tools will count that as covered, whereas in the above form it will think it missed a line.  That is, code coverage doesn't count branches or anything like that, it's a very superficial and unsophisticated analysis.</p>",
