There seem to be some implicit assumptions made in PkgDev which give me hard time here; some combination of :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PkgDev assumes that you have a <em>fork</em> or the registry rather than being the owner (<a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl/issues/185\">https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl/issues/185</a>)</li>\n<li>PkgDev assumes supports does not like the fact that I'm using SSH (<a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl/issues/188\">https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl/issues/188</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are there any known workarounds? Any best tips for maintaining a personal registry without a lot of extra effort w.r.t. tagging, publishing etc? Or is PkgDev simply not meant to be used with local registries?</p>",
