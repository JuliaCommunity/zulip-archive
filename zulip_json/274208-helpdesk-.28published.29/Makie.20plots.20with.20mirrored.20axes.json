I can do it manually by just having two Axis elements and configuring them identically except for the <code>xaxisposition</code> and <code>yaxisposition</code> parameters. Is there an option to just mirror the axes, so I don't have to write all the attributes for <code>ax1</code> and then also  for<code>ax2</code>? I guess I could also maybe first modify <code>ax1</code>, then copy it to <code>ax2</code> and just flip the axes there. But I haven't tried that yet and I am not even sure I know how to do that.</p>",
