The hectic deadlines made me code the package without caring too much about testing, documenting and stuff like that. I'm now in the process of organizing the code, and making it proper.</p>\n<p>I was wondering what are some current \"best practices\" on package development here in the Julia community. For example, I remember seeing some packages using a package called <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/Aqua\">Aqua.jl</a><br>\nAny ways, I'm looking for helpful packages and tips on setting up tests/docs and the like... Any useful tip is welcomed!</p>\n<p>I'm also interested in tests for performance. Stuff like type stability. Which I didn't check when I first coded.</p>",
