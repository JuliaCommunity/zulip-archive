Adding <code>@info</code> calls before and after modifying indicates it works. However, they are only emmited during precompilation, and when loading the package nothing seems to happen and the variable is not modified</p>\n<p>So, am I correct in guessing the way to make this work would be by preventing the statement from being precompiled? If so, how might I accomplish this?</p>",
