I can render it in Jupyter using <code>HTML(mysvg_string)</code>. The problem arises when trying to add some javascript to provide interactivity.</p>\n<p>I've tried creating a full HTML file and placing the javascript <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. But this did not work. I also tried placing the tag within the svg using <code>CDATA</code>. Also did not work. This last option seems to be what packages like <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/Gadfly\">Gadfly.jl</a> does. But I couldn't make it work for my case. Note that, if I open the html file in a browser, the interactivity does work. Hence, the issue seems to be something related to how to get it to work on Jupyter (I think).</p>\n<p>Does anybody know an easy example to make this work?</p>",
