It would be more verbose and less readable than a CSV but for \"small\" amounts of data could work. It supports a type called an <a href=\"https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables\">Array of Tables</a> which is basically identical to a vector of named tuples i.e. a <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/Tables\">Tables.jl</a> compatible source (I don't actually know what <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/TOML\">TOML.jl</a> converts this to but presumably getting it back into a DataFrame should be pretty easy).</p>\n<p>edit: I went and checked and <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/TOML\">TOML.jl</a> generates a dictionary containing a vector of dictionaries. It'd take a bit of finagling to convert the dictionaries all to named tuples and eventually into a DataFrame but definitely conceivable.</p>",

Maybe there is already a standard for this, but my understanding was that it is not necessarily guaranteed that you are supposed to treat paths in HDF5 as paths in a file system.</p>",

And alternatives that handle this sort of key-value store well (JSON, TOML, etc.) in turn don't handle anything larger than very small tables gracefully or at all. Clearly there <em>could</em> be a universal meta-data CSV standard but we (society writ large, not Julia community) haven't managed to do so.</p>",

I tried that approach and the senior engineers (not computer science but other engineering fields) at my employer were a) intolerant of change and b) refused to use anything that can't be investigated as text since they don't trust any binary reader program to still work 150 years from now which apparently is a crucial requirement.
