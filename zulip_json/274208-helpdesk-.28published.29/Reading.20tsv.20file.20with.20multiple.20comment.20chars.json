But few of the files have comments with the '#' symbol and header with '|' symbols. I don't need any of the headers, only data. Example file: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Julia\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c\"># comment line 1</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># comment line 2</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># comment line 3</span>\n<span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">first</span> <span class=\"n\">column</span><span class=\"o\">|</span>  <span class=\"n\">second</span> <span class=\"n\">column</span><span class=\"o\">|</span>  <span class=\"n\">third</span> <span class=\"n\">column</span><span class=\"o\">|</span>\n<span class=\"mf\">0.12415</span>         <span class=\"mf\">125125.222</span>      <span class=\"mi\">123132512</span>\n<span class=\"mf\">1.8950</span>          <span class=\"mf\">555124.1</span>        <span class=\"mi\">910520</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Is there a nice way to be able to handle all those files? Usually, I use <code>readdlm</code>, but it only allows one character for comments. I am not familiar with CSV and was not able to find a way to handle these files well. There is, of course, <code>skipstart</code> and similar options, but I would prefer not to set them manually for each file.</p>",
