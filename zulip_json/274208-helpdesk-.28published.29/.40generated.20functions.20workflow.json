Revise can't always handle changes to <code>@generated</code> functions (<a href=\"https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/limitations/#Macros-and-generated-functions-1\">https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/limitations/#Macros-and-generated-functions-1</a>) so if I'm playing around in the REPL I call <code>revise(MyModule)</code> and that works fine, but I can't find a way to trigger that in the test process. So if I run <code>MyModuleTests.retest()</code>, change the code, and run the tests again, the old function will be used.</p>\n<p>How do you all deal with that? In this case I could rewrite it as a couple of regular functions but it'd be nice not to.</p>",
