The widgets are the part I want to be reactive. </p>\n<p>The breaking point for me was when I made a little dashboard for data entry where the you input some data in various reactive textboxes, and then once you click a button, it <code>push!</code>s some computed data to a <code>DataFrame</code>. I had been very careful to do a bunch of tricks to make sure Pluto didn't destroy my dataframe while I was building it up, but then at the end of the process after I had spent like 20 minutes inputing data, I I wrote that data to disk, and then did one thing to check to make sure the data was right and  a stray side effect caused Pluto to recompute the whole notebook, emptied my intermediate dataframe, and wrote the now empty dataframe to disk, overwriting the previous record I wrote</p>",
