Then, when you paste some code, this should be disabled (the REPL normally recognizes that you are pasting, so auto-indent is temporarily disabled). But in some circumstances (I don't remember when, maybe with some Windows shell?), this is not recognized, so each new line of the pasted code, presumably already indented, gets more spaces added in front because of auto-indentation.</p>",
