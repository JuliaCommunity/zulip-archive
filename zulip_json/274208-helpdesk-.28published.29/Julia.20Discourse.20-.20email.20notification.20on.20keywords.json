They also have to decide who to enable the feature for -  every saved search is automatically run once a day everyday (and then email notifications possibly sent out), and over many thousands of members that might end up costly in terms of server compute. But in practice it might not be that heavily used anyway, so it's worth asking on Discourse if they're open to adding this plugin and enabling it.</p>",
