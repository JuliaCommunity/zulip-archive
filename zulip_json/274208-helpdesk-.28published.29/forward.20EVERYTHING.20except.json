Say if you have an array wrapper, how would you define <code>empty!</code> on it? Typically, <code>empty!</code> returns the emptied collection, in this case it should be the wrapper, but with forwarding it will return the result of <code>empty!</code> called on the wrapped array, and so, the wrapped array will be returned. Same story for algebraic operations, where e.g. adding two array wrappers should return an array wrapper, not the addition of the wrapped arrays which are a different type. But there, you don't want to return one of the original arguments (as you would with <code>empty!</code>), but actually rewrap the result into a new array wrapper. Then you have also problems with method ambiguities, where if you declare <code>f(t::MyType, args...; kwargs...) = f(t.inner, args...; kwargs...)</code>, you may run into dispatch issues depending on what methods are defined for <code>f</code> and specifically what was the type signature on <code>args</code>: say <code>f(::Any, ::Integer, ::Integer)</code> was defined, you'd need to actually define <code>f(::MyType, ::Integer, ::Integer)</code>. I believe the list of issues and corner cases may go on for a while, the conclusion being that such a generic forward wrapping is either not well defined or faces significant implementation challenges.</p>",
