Are there any updated docs for <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=TerminalUserInterfaces.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">TerminalUserInterfaces.jl</a>? <a href=\"https://kdheepak.com/TerminalUserInterfaces.jl/stable/usage/\">These docs</a> talk about <code>initialize</code> and <code>cleanup</code> functions which don't seem to exist anymore. Based on the examples folder, it seems like the current way is to subtype TUI.Model, but it's not clear how the whole thing works, what the Model-subtype struct is supposed to contain, etc.</p>",

Once that's done, I'll be writing docs and cutting a release.</p>",
