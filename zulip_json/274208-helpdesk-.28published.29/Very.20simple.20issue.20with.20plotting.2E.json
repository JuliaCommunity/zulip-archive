What you wrote above seems to work fine for me (on Julia v.1.7.0, <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Plots.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Plots.jl</a> v1.25.2).</p>\n<p>On a side note: We don't need to add semicolons to the end of every statement in Julia. They're mostly just for hiding the output that is automatically displayed if we want</p>",

I wish I had a better answer for you, just in case someone else runs into this same issue in the future, but eventually it just started working.  I have no clue what I did to fix this problem :-/</p>\n<p>Still, thanks for all your help!</p>",
