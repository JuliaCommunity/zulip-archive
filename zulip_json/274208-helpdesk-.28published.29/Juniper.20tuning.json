Problem has about 900 binary variables.</p>\n<p>Is it e.g. possible to find advice for what is a good strategy if all constraints are linear (and presumably it is very easy to find feasible solutions) and it is just the objective which is non-linear. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the non-linearity of the objective does not seem to matter much; Even if I change to a linear objective Juniper seems to choke (while Cbc solves it near instantly). </p>\n<p>Here is a (perhaps too) simplified mwe for the latter. In case it is not clear from the example I'm not very experienced with mathematical programming so I'm fully aware that I might have formulated the problem in a stupid way.</p>\n<div

E.g. if Cbc can't solve the linear mwe then there would be little hope for Juniper to solve the non-linear version and I would need to think of another way to formulate the problem. </p>\n<p>I'm not expecting Juniper to solve it as fast as Cbc due to the very reasons you mentioned. More hoping that there would exist some guideline when constraints are linear/simple (e.g. use more strong branching). It was a shot in the dark given how little I know about how to tackle MINLPs.</p>\n<p>Eitherway, I'm just basically toying around and if there is no simple guide here I'll just keep playing with it a bit while reading up on the different strategies while the program runs to see if I get an idea. That is also part of the fun.</p>\n<p>Fwiw, I do get pretty good solutions if I set the time out. Perhaps I'll add a genetic algorithm to play with the Juniper strategies <img alt=\":troll:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/e6ff66d298aadec033da2842b9d22acd7cabaab7/68747470733a2f2f7a756c69702d617661746172732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f373137382f656d6f6a692f696d616765732f31353235322e706e67\" title=\"troll\"></p>",
