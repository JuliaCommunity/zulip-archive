I can usually get it to work after a couple of attempts, but it never renders when I use the QuartoNotebookRunner engine and sometimes hangs when I use the Jupyter kernel to render the chapter. This makes me think that I have not correctly implemented the code example? Would someone mind taking a look at a the example beginning <code>using Distributed</code> in this section and tell me if I have any correctness issues?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://modernfinancialmodeling.com/parallelization#sec-multi-device\">https://modernfinancialmodeling.com/parallelization#sec-multi-device</a></p>",
