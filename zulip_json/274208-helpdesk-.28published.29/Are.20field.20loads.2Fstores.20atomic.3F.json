The term is rather overloaded, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p>For one thing, you may worry about whether you can see a \"torn read\" where some bits of a wide word come before an update vs some after.  IIUC this isn't something to worry about in practice right now, as you've stated. At least for reasonable sized word widths with correct alignment.</p>\n<p>But considerations like torn reads are really only one consequence of data races, potentially not even the major consequence.</p>\n<p>Much more tricky is how data races interact with compiler optimizations. The compiler is allowed to do all sorts of program transformations under the assumption that your code is data race free. On the other hand, if your program has data races many of these compiler transformations can just become invalid.
