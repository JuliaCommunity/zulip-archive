I have a tree-like data structure where the leafs are all of an abstract type <code>G</code>. <br>\nNow, consider a variable <code>x::A</code> where <code>A&lt;:G</code>.<br>\nThe thing is that when I run a function such as <code>x-&gt;x</code> over the data structure, it returns values of type <code>A</code>, so that, for example, a vector previously of type <code>Vector{G}</code> becomes of type <code>Vector{A}</code>. Is there a way to avoid this?</p>",
