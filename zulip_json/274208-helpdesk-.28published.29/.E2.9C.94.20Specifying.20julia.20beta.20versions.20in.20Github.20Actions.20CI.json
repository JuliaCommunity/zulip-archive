The tilde restricts it to patches starting with <code>1.8.</code>, so <code>~1.8.0-0</code> would match all versions <code>â‰¥ 1.8.0</code> and <code>&lt; 1.9.0</code> including <code>1.8.0-beta2</code>. In the range, it always picks the highest available version. You could also use <code>~1.8.0-beta2</code> which includes all pre-releases starting from <code>beta2</code>, e.g. <code>beta3</code>, <code>rc1</code>. Does that help?</p>\n<p>There's also a <a href=\"https://replit.com/@SaschaMann/setup-julia-version-logic#index.js\">REPL</a> that goes through some release scenarios that you can play around with.</p>",
