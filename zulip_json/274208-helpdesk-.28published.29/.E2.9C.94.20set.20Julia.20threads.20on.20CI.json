Also, if you're only using Github-hosted runners you don't have any choice, you get what they give you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"455681\">Leandro Martínez</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/274208-helpdesk-.28published.29/topic/set.20Julia.20threads.20on.20CI/near/488860190\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I use <code>JULIA_NUM_THREADS: 10</code> will this bring any issue or computing demand for running the tests?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Worst that can happen is that the job will be slow because the machine will be oversubscribed.
