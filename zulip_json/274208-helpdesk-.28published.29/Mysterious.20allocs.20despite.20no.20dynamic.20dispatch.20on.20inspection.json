A user is seeing allocations, yet using <code>@code_*</code> and Cthulhu don't turn up any calls which could be responsible for so many allocations. Using the allocation profiler wasn't much help either: it showed a bunch of allocations seemingly related to tuple indexing and dynamic dispatch (e.g. <code>apply</code> stuff), but I can't tell <em>why</em> those are happening because I can't coax out IR which shows such calls.</p>",
