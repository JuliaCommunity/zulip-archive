The short version is that <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Automa.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Automa.jl</a> works by creating _very_ large machine-generated functions by computing some <code>Expr</code> objects, interpolating them in, and <code>eval</code>'ing the function. Currently, some expression are being interpolated many times in the function, which leads to excessively large code. That's bad for compilation, cache usage, you name it.</p>\n<p>I'd like to factor it out, and I can think of two ways of doing it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take each expression and wrap it in a function. Interpolate those functions in once, then replace the old places where the code was interpolated in with function calls. The issue is that the code may access variables in the outer scope, and I worry this would be super inefficient. So here, I would need to have a way of creating \"functions without scopes\" - that is - literally just a block of code that can be jumped into and then out of again.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, I can manually manipulate the stack and add in <code>callq</code> and <code>popq</code> instructions. But then I would need to be able to specify \"push the memory location of this expression onto the stack\", and I don't think that is possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is this a solvable problem in Julia?</p>",

Here are the details:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Automa.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Automa.jl</a> is a package for generating parsers, lexers and similar programs. The user inputs some regexes, and some Julia code (<code>Expr</code> objects) that should be executed at each regex. Automa then computes the optimal finite state machine that parses the given regexes, and then creates a function that parses the code and executes the input Expr objects.<br>\nThe issue is that while the user may specify a regex input once, that regex may correspond to many states in the state machine, and the result is that the input Expr object is interpolated many times into the large function</p>",

It's a very efficient approach. Purity works great for the compiler. This is why <code>foldl</code>/<code>reduce</code>-based iteration that I use in <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Transducers.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Transducers.jl</a> is so powerful. It wouldn't be possible to all that stuff if I modeled the iteration as <code>foreach</code> (i.e., equivalent to how <code>f</code> is used) instead of <code>foldl</code> (i.e., how <code>g</code> is used).</p>\n<p>Maybe you could use <code>Base.Experimental.@opaque</code> and hope that Keno will implement enough optimizations you need.
