Am I correct in thinking that the easiest way to do that would be to ccall socketpair()? In this case all the communication will be internal to the process so I don't want to listen on a port. I'm thinking that I'll pass one file descriptor to the C library and wrap the other in an IOStream to read/write to it.</p>",
