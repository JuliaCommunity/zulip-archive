        "content": "<p>OK, I can give some more insights.<br>\nActually, what I have measured and plotted seems to depend quite a lot on the computation history, certainly through memory and CPU states. After many joint attempts, Julia's standard (complex) 2D fft without and with plan_fft keep up quite well with Matlab. I don't know whether Matlab uses a garbage collector, but after many runs, the timing distributions for both Julia and Matlab are quite close and bimodal (supposedly runs without garbage collection and runs with it...).</p>\n<p>Here are the differences: Julia's fft has a delay (overhead) of 1ms as compared to Julia's plan_fft (about 10%), that achieves the same absolute minimal timing as Matlab (6ms). However, Julia's plan_fft (complex 2D) is 17% slower in average than Matlab's (complex  2D) fft. It could mean that garbage collection is quicker in Matlab.<br>\nAlso, for this same computation, Julia uses 66% of the total CPU resources while Matlab takes only 41% (both using all 16 threads). Here again, Matlab's old age is a synonym of efficiency.</p>\n<p>Satisfyingly, Julia's plan_rfft (for real 2D input) is 4 to 5 times faster (min 1.4ms, mean 1.8ms) than Matlab's always complex fft ;-)  (At least today... A fresh run of Julia seems slower while a fresh run in Matlab seems faster.)</p>",
