Or at least from a source written in a common language, e.g. <strong>markdown</strong> or similar. </p>\n<p>My previous experience with this dates back a number of years before notebooks were popular and  only worked with R: I used knitr with a markdown source to produce html and pdf output. Fast forward to today: I'd like to be able to support <strong>Julia</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>R</strong> and, if at all possible, output <strong>Jupyter</strong> or <strong>Pluto</strong> notebooks! <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span></p>\n<p>Context: I'm writing up an intro course in econometrics where students would be free to choose one of several languages: the department head wants me to use R, the previous instructor wants me to use Python, and I personally would like to have Julia as an option too! In my vision, I would have a markdown source and would produce beamer slides Jupyter/Pluto notebooks, with some degree of multi-language support. The code for each language would most likely be in separate files that would be sourced from one or several master file.</p>\n<p>Your suggestion? <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>",
