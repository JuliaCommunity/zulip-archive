The only problem is the inconsistency in the files. As I've said, the number of columns grows each time there is a difference. Hence why I was using the <code>append!</code> with <code>cols=:union</code>.</p>",

FWIW I ended up doing something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Julia\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">colnames</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">names</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">CSV</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">list_of_csv_files</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">DataFrame</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">limit</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which I then converted to a DataFrame for an easy overview over all the names in all tables. In my case I only had a few hundred CSVs and it turned out there were only a dozen or so different patterns of column names, so it wasn't too hard to fix, especially after doing <code>[lowercase.(x) for x in colnames]</code> as a lot of it turned out to be inconsistent capitalization...</p>",
