Benchmarking with small arrays usually backs up this perception. However, in my real life code, where I usually work with 512x512x80x200 arrays, I think this might be detrimental, i.e. that the cost of repeatedly doing operations with data that is non-contiguous in memory (for example in the fourth dimension) might actually be costlier than makin a copy once and then operating on a slice that is now contiguous data. </p>\n<p>Is there a rule of thumb to decide when to use views and when to use regular slicing? For example, even unrolling a loop instead of creating slices could benefit from a copy if the data points are too far from each other, right?</p>",
