This made compilation time for my first construction of an <code>A</code> something like ten times slower until I realized that <code>abstract type A{S,T}</code> was good enough, which completely fixed the performance issue. Can anybody explain why this might happen at this level of abstraction, or would I need to get more specific?</p>",
