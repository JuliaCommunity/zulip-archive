(I got some warnings about removing stale pidfiles etc.)  Also, it seems that the package ExcelFiles (which I needed to read old .xls files that a collaborator sent me) was causing some issues, so I removed it for now.<br>\nI'm not marking it as resolved yet, because I still don't understand what triggers precompilation. After another restart it's started precompiling again even though I didn't change any code...<br>\nEDIT: after some more cleaning up, removing unneeded dependencies and several restarts it now finally restarts almost instantly, and the TTFP is very low :)</p>",
