That means I want the plots to be in pdf format and with a certain physical size, or more specifically I want the font size to correspond to the physical size so it is the same size as the text in the article. I am using a theme for plotting that does the sizing and setup for the pdf.</p>\n<p>I am trying out Pluto workflow where I group similar plots into a single Pluto notebook and I would like to be able to first play around with the plot in the Pluto notebook and only when I have somewhat finished the figure save it as a pdf. The problem is when I use the size I want for the final pdf, then the display size in Pluto is very small.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to upscale the displayed image in the notebook without changing all the sizes for the plot? I guess I could make another theme for displaying in the notebook, but maybe there is something simpler?</p>",
