For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Julia\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">exp</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"o\">^</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, a naive approach might calculate <code>a(x)</code> twice, whereas I'd like to do the computation once. I'd also ideally like to calculate <code>d(y)</code> and <code>c(x)</code> in parallel.  The actual update step is of course much more complex, with a few thousand functions where the dependencies are very difficult to keep track of. </p>\n<p>Is Symbolics a good approach for this? On the one hand, <code>substitute</code> and <code>simplify</code> look really helpful, but I have a hard time telling from the documentation whether Symbolics actually does this reuse &amp; parallelization.</p>",
