I have more experience with <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/DifferentialEquations\">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, so the question is probably rather: Is there any benefit to switch to <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/DynamicalSystems\">DynamicalSystems.jl</a> (and why)? I don't have my model ready, yet, just wanted to get an idea.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/DynamicalSystems\">DynamicalSystems.jl</a> code calls the other (well I think it uses <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/SimpleDiffEq\">SimpleDiffEq.jl</a> SimpleFunctionMap for a bit more performance, but same idea). <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/DynamicalSystems\">DynamicalSystems.jl</a> has some extra analysis functionality so if you want to use those functions on it then it needs to be the DS one. Though future refractors via dual numbers could probably eliminate the difference</p>",
