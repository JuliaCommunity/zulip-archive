From looking at their pages and a thread in Discourse I gather that the author of PrettyPrint wrote it unaware of the PrettyPrinting package, which is a little older.</p>\n<p>So my question is, is either of these considered the go-to package? PrettyPrinting seems to be slightly more actively developed and has more stars in GitHub for what that's worth.</p>\n<p>In particular though PrettyPrint seems to be able to print arbitrary <code>struct</code>s out of the box while PrettyPrinting requires a function to be extended.</p>\n<p>Obviously I don't necessarily have to choose though I am curious if one package or the other is more widely used or recommended for whatever reason.</p>",
