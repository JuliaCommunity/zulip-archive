Looking at that package's <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/blob/master/Project.toml#L68\"><code>Project.toml</code></a>, I notice that it lists compatibility only with julia version 1.4 and above, and it looks like you're on julia version 1.0. It's possible there are no versions of the package that are known to work with julia v1.0</p>\n<p>Is there some reason to be on julia v1.0? If you're able, I'd suggest using the most recent stable version (currently v1.5)</p>",
