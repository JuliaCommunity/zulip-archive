The way I'm dealing with this now is to have a <code>Tigers/setup.jl</code> script that you run to dev the <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Stripes.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Stripes.jl</a> repo before you build <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Tigers.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Tigers.jl</a>. With recentish Pkg updates I thought I'd automate this with <code>deps/build.jl</code> or similar, but I can't figure anything out. My naive approach is to dev <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Stripes.jl&amp;type=Repositories\">Stripes.jl</a> in build.jl, but apparently Stripes needs to be registered (or dev'd) before the build file is run-- no build log is even produced before the error pops up (ERROR: expected package <code>Stripes [310cc8c8]</code> to be registered).</p>\n<p>I'm working around this by including Manifest.toml in the repo, but that doesn't seem like a \"real\" solution. Maybe there's just no real solution since packages shouldn't automatically depend on unregistered/implicitly untrusted git repos?</p>",

There have been discussions about mechanisms to counteract it but it's all somewhat complicated by the fact that Pkg is designed to allow migration between registries. Note that the problem is slightly mitigated by the fact that instantiating a Manifest  doesn't bring in a new version just because it exists in the registry. The danger comes when you do a package update.</p>",
